# PhD-Research-Phase-3-Motor-Synergies-Post-Stroke

This is the analysis code I wrote for the third major study of my PhD.

This work investigates if:

1) The post-stroke motor synergies of the unaffected arm are similar to those of the healthy population. 
2) How stroke changes the motor synergies of the affected arm.

The data that was used for this analysis is not included here.
