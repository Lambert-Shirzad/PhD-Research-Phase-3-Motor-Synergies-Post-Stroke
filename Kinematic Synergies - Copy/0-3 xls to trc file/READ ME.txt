use template.trc as a template. 
open it with excel.
copy paste the data from marker.xlsx files that you have created (resampled and filtered).
Do not worry about the formatting, the order of markers in OpenSim and template.trc are the same
as the kinect marker order in the resampled+filtered files. 
make sure to update the "frame number" column, as well as the number of frames in the headings
of the trc file (2 different locations). Data Rate needs to be updated to be equal to the resampling
frequency.
Save as another trc file.
