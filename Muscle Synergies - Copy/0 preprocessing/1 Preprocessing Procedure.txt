In EMGworks Analysis, go to the existing worksheet called "preprocessing". Open raw emg data files (saved from EMGworks Acquisition). 
Go to Tool > Export to text file and export the raw data into a CSV file. 

Open MATLAB and run CreateMATfromCSV.m function to save the raw data as .mat (which is easier/faster to open in matlab).
Run FilterRmsNormalizeEMG.m in MATLAB to Filter and RMS and Normalize the data. 

You are done with preprocessiong. Use Processed_Subj_##_Right and Processed_Subj_##_Left to look at synergies.
